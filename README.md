 # Terraform Scripts
 <br>
 In this repository, you will find terraform scripts for both AWS and Azure as these are the main providers I have used in the industry over time the aim is to add more complex scripts and eventually scripts for GCP in future releases.
 <br>
 This document will include the initial setup,  Extension recommendations and future scripts I plan to make as I learn more about Terraform and IAC.

 # Installations and Extension Recommendations

 ### Windows
 <br>
 [To manually download Terraform for windows please select the appropriate executable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
 
<br>
Next, you need to open your advanced system settings and edit the path within the environment variables tab.
<br>

Once you have opened environmental variables you need to point the path to the terraform binary you just downloaded.
<br>
To verify that terraform is installed open up PowerShell and run the following command terraform -help
<br>
